		<p>If you know basic JavaScript, you'll understand how to use this library.</p>
		<p>Basic function, from which all begin is <i>Helpers.take().</i> It takes as parameter a universal selector, like in css. (If you know  very popular JS library jQuery, it use universal css-selector as well.) And this function returns an object, with which we'll work. For example: <i>var a=Helpers.take('#element-id');</i> where are <i>var a</i> is our main object, <i>element-id</i> - id of element we want to handle.</p>
		<p>The next function is <i>ourObject.kbhit()</i>. It takes as parameters string and callback function. String is a single letter or combination of keys. Callback-function - function, which you want to handle on keypress event. Example of usage this function: <i>ourObject.kbhit('string', functionsName)</i>. ourObject is object, which we have got from <i>Helpers.take()</i> function. 'string' can be a single letter, such as 'o' or 'L', and can be a combination of keys name, such as 'l+shift', 'f+shift', 'home', 'enter', 'space', 'backspace' etc. And callback-function is function we want to handle on different keypress.</p>
		<p>And the last function is <i>ourObject.anti('string')</i>. This function removes handler from keypress. It takes as parameter string value, which is identical to string which we pass into kbhit() function as first parameter.</p>
